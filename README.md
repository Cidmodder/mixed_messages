# mixed_messages
The goal of this project was to create 3 unique messages that would randomize after recieving an input. I chose to do story hooks for a table top rpg.
You should see a short intro explaining the page, three unique lines, a background image, and a button to generate new text.
When you click the button, one of three unique messages should appear in each of the three lines and the background image should change to correspond to the first message.
